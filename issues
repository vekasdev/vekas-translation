- i have a language validator and the issue were in where to put it in pattern design system 
is it in dictionery class but the issue were because if when swap the language manually ( which is not designed to behave like it at all ) 

solution : make it on dictionery class to be passed as dependencies to it altogether with the handler interface



- complete write the validation role in dictionery class <<tests>>

- in case of choosing in JsonDictioneryFactory like en => en or ar => ar

- change the mehod name findOpposit into translate



- test jsonDictioeryFactory #complete
- test language validators #complete
- in case of choosing in JsonDictioneryFactory like en => en or ar => ar
  make a null object that returns the same text #complete


- make a setup system by xml for config and set data like translation files for json Dictionaries 
- make command to create two languages pairs


- handle the case when the user look for not exactly data to translate but part of it ( in phrases ) the programme should find the closest translation for it


- make one function in dictionary that swap two language and test it -- done

- test and implement the new updates of making dictionary switching its languages and validate it alogside with the source language and fill the missing in tests in the application --done
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- in scenario of there is an item of arabic lang originally and the page wanted to translate en -> ar the app will throw wrong language value exception then the act is catch this error and return the same text or the exception wrong language should have method getDetectedLanguageType ( when throwing wrongLanguageValue 
its advicable to get detected language and receive it to exception object data ) -------- done

* write test for language detector and its working on the dictionary class  ------- done 


- in dictionary interface findOpposit when not exist must return null instead of string in annotations 

- make class that handle auto-detect language and translate based on it

- make ability to translate phrases not only word ... !

- make dictionary interface implements the two the languageHandlerInterface and LanguagePairInterface
