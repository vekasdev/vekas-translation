- i have a language validator and the issue were in where to put it in pattern design system 
is it in dictionery class but the issue were because if when swap the language manually ( which is not designed to behave like it at all ) 

solution : make it on dictionery class to be passed as dependencies to it altogether with the handler interface



- complete write the validation role in dictionery class <<tests>>

- in case of choosing in JsonDictioneryFactory like en => en or ar => ar

- change the mehod name findOpposit into translate
